# eslint-config-selbekk

This eslint config is just how I like it. It's based off of AirBnB's config,
with a few overrides because reasons.

## Usage

If you're not me, and you'd like to use this, simply install and extend:

IT ALSO WORKS WITH NPM INSTALL :poop:

```bash
yarn add --dev eslint-config-selbekk
```

In your `.eslintrc` file, add this lil' snippet

```javascript
{
    "extends": "selbekk",
    // Rest of config goes here
}
```
